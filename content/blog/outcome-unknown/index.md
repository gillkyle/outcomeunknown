My friend Pramit and I send a lot of good articles for parents to one another. Many times I end up sending them on to other parents (like you). While Cassidy was down for a nap today, Pramit and I hatched the idea of starting a weekly newsletter with 3-5 links to good articles we've read recently. We're calling it Outcome Unknown. We figured this would be a better way to share those links to a wider audience and maybe discover some new ones from our friends.  

If you want to help, there are a couple of ways you can contribute. You can tell your other parent friends about [the list](https://tinyletter.com/outcomeunknown) and you can send us links that you come across. If you're not into any of this, we'll only be slightly offended by you clicking the unsubscribe link below, but don't let that stop you.

Here are a few reads to get you started.
