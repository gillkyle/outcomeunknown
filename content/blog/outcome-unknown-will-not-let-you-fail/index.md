[Global Parenting Habits That Haven't Caught On In The U.S.](http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/08/12/339825261/global-parenting-habits-that-havent-caught-on-in-the-u-s)  
Can you imagine leaving your kid in a stroller on the curb while you ate inside of a restaurant? How about letting your kids go to bed at 10pm? Different cultures have different styles and parenting customs and it doesn't mean they're doing it wrong. (thx Pramit)  

[Kids And Screen Time: What Does The Research Say?â€‹](http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/08/28/343735856/kids-and-screen-time-what-does-the-research-say)  
Just because we sit in front of screens all day doesn't mean our kids
should. BTW, we probably shouldn't either.  There's some interesting new research from UCLA that's worth reading on your glowing screen of choice. Dig deeper by following the links in the story.

[What Should a 4 Year Old Know?](http://magicalchildhood.wordpress.com/2010/08/31/what-should-a-4-year-old-know/)  
Our society has become an increasingly competitive, but parenting isn't a race. Our kids need space and less structure than we think. Placing importance on beating other kids, particularly when it comes to developmental milestones can do more harm than good. (thx Amy)

[A Better Way to Say Sorry](http://www.cuppacocoa.com/a-better-way-to-say-sorry/)
Even at 40 years old, I remember the feeling of doing something unkind to someone else and being forced to apologize for it. I love the idea of putting in a little work to have our children understand exactly why they're sorry instead of begrudgingly repeating something we're saying.     

[The Key To Success? Grit](http://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_the_key_to_success_grit#t-361253)  
Angela Lee Duckworth's TED video is worth six minutes of your day. In a world of instant gratification, it's challenging to teach our kids perseverance over long periods of time, but doing so could have a massively positive impact on there lives as children and adults. (thx Greg)
